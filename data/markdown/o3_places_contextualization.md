The city’s skyline is famously dominated by the Petronas Twin Towers – once the world’s tallest buildings – whose design (by César Pelli) includes Islamic geometric motifs and a postmodern take on Malaysia’s image
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Petronas Towers have become an icon of KL and symbolize the country’s leap into modernity and globalization. Around them, gleaming skyscrapers and mega-developments like the KL Tower, Merdeka 118 (which is currently one of the tallest structures globally), and massive shopping complexes showcase KL’s modern architecture boom. Yet, at street level, one finds British colonial-era buildings (e.g. the Sultan Abdul Samad Building with its Indo-Saracenic style) and traditional shophouses in districts like Chinatown, reflecting older layers of the city’s history. According to its city profile, “the architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a blend of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, [and] modern and postmodern mix.”
en.wikipedia.org
 Colonial-era structures from the late 19th century feature Mughal and Neo-Gothic details adapted to the tropics (high ceilings, verandas)
en.wikipedia.org
. After independence (1957) and especially from the 1970s–90s during Malaysia’s economic rise, a wave of construction added local character: many public buildings incorporated Islamic motifs and forms inspired by traditional Malay art (like the songket pattern or the shape of a Malay dagger, as noted in designs of the era)
en.wikipedia.org
. For instance, the National Mosque’s design includes a multi-fold umbrella-like roof, and the Dayabumi Complex features Islamic arches. Kuala Lumpur’s urban planning also reflects Southeast Asian realities – a car-centric layout with new transit-oriented developments now trying to improve connectivity. All in all, KL offers a unique architectural tapestry where ultramodern skyscrapers coexist with historic mosques and colonial landmarks, illustrating Malaysia’s motto of “Unity in Diversity.” Culturally and professionally, Kuala Lumpur is known for its diversity and bilingual (even trilingual) business environment. Malays, Chinese, Indians, and expatriates all intermingle in KL’s workforce, and English is widely used in professional settings, making it relatively easy for an international consultant to operate. The city’s business culture is somewhat formal and relationship-based – respecting hierarchies and showing deference to elders or superiors is customary (a reflection of traditional Asian values). However, KL’s corporate scene, especially in tech, has become quite cosmopolitan and meritocratic. One might find a Malay CEO, a Chinese Malaysian CTO, and an expat product designer all working together in a startup. Networking often happens at industry events or through government-linked programs, given the Malaysian government’s active role in the economy. An international consultant would do well to understand Malaysia’s socio-cultural context: for example, being mindful of Islamic practices (no meetings during Friday prayers, halal dining options, etc.) and the holiday calendar of multiple ethnic groups. The reward is a very welcoming environment – Malaysians are generally friendly and proud to showcase their city. Kuala Lumpur also offers a high quality of life at a relatively low cost, which attracts foreign entrepreneurs and digital nomads. The city’s position in the heart of Southeast Asia gives a consultant access to a regional market of over 600 million people. In summary, Kuala Lumpur combines a supportive, growing tech ecosystem with a culturally rich setting, where an international AI/architecture consultant can find both cutting-edge projects and meaningful cross-cultural experiences.

. Indeed, many foreign entrepreneurs choose Barcelona for its combination of beachside livability and growing tech opportunities. For an AI/design consultant, Barcelona offers a dynamic environment where smart urbanism and creative digital projects are flourishing against a backdrop of rich culture. Barcelona’s architectural significance is world-famous, anchored by the legacy of Antoni Gaudí and the Modernisme movement. The city is often described as an open-air museum of architecture. “From Gaudí’s modernism to avant-garde contemporary designs, the Catalonian capital is an ever-evolving canvas”, marrying innovation with sustainability
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. Gaudí’s masterpieces – the still-unfinished Sagrada Família basilica, the whimsical Park Güell, Casa Batlló, Casa Milà (La Pedrera) – are emblematic of Barcelona’s identity
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. These landmark buildings, with their organic forms and colorful mosaics, illustrate how deeply architecture is woven into Barcelona’s cultural fabric. But the city’s architectural story doesn’t end with Gaudí. The medieval Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic) showcases Barcelona’s older heritage: narrow stone streets, the 14th-century Cathedral, and ancient Roman remnants under the city. In the 19th century, visionary planner Ildefons Cerdà designed the Eixample district’s distinctive grid pattern with chamfered corners – an early example of comprehensive urban planning aimed at light, ventilation, and mobility. Many elegant Modernista buildings line the Eixample’s boulevards as a result (by architects like Domènech i Montaner and Puig i Cadafalch alongside Gaudí). In the late 20th century, preparing for the 1992 Olympics, Barcelona underwent a dramatic urban revival: the waterfront was redeveloped, new parks and museums were built, and contemporary architecture got a boost. Today, Barcelona’s skyline includes bold modern structures like the Torre Glòries (Agbar Tower) – a glimmering bullet-shaped skyscraper by Jean Nouvel – and Santiago Calatrava’s Olympic communications tower. The city is also known for innovative public architecture and design: projects like the Mediapro Building, Disseny Hub Barcelona, and the Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA) exemplify Barcelona’s commitment to modern architecture that is intelligent and sustainable
thedecorativesurfaces.com
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. In fact, sustainability is key in current designs; Torre Glòries, for instance, was one of the first European towers with an “A” energy efficiency rating
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. Barcelona doesn’t treat the city as static – it’s “a laboratory of living architecture… where experiments and innovation are never-ending”, including participatory urban planning and a strong public space design ethos
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. It’s no surprise Barcelona has been named the World Capital of Architecture for 2026, recognizing its historical and contemporary architectural leadership
thedecorativesurfaces.com
. In terms of professional culture, Barcelona offers a slightly different flavor than Northern Europe – warm and relational, yet highly creative. Business in Barcelona (and Spain in general) often revolves around personal connections; people appreciate face-to-face meetings (over a leisurely lunch or evening tapas). However, Catalonia in particular has a strong entrepreneurial streak and an outward-looking mentality. International consultants will find that many in Barcelona’s business community speak English (especially in tech and design sectors), though learning some Spanish or Catalan is appreciated as a sign of commitment. Catalan culture prizes design and craftsmanship – Barcelona is a global design capital, home to institutions like the Foment de les Arts i del Disseny (FAD) and host of Barcelona Design Week. Thus, professionals in architecture or design-related fields are held in high regard. An international consultant might also note the collaborative atmosphere: Barcelona’s innovation hubs and coworking spaces (e.g. Pier01 in the Port Olímpic or Aticco co-working) buzz with meetups and cross-pollination between startups, designers, and engineers. The lifestyle (sunny climate, rich food, art, and beach) makes networking a pleasure, but one should also be mindful of local work customs – for instance, the later rhythm of the day (many offices might take a mid-day break or work into the evening). Additionally, as a major tourist destination and expatriate hub, Barcelona is adept at integrating people from abroad; Juan Garassino teaching or consulting here would likely find a receptive audience eager to learn global best practices in AI or architecture. In conclusion, Barcelona provides an environment where a consultant can draw on a strong design tradition, a growing tech ecosystem, and a collaborative, creative culture – all centered in a city that continuously reinvents itself while cherishing its unique heritage.
University of Buenos Aires – Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo (FADU)
The University of Buenos Aires (UBA) is one of Latin America’s most prestigious universities, and its Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism (Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo, or FADU) is a cornerstone of architectural education in the region. Established in 1901 as the country’s first architecture program, UBA’s architecture school has a proud history and enormous scale
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. It began as part of UBA’s Faculty of Sciences, initially influenced heavily by French Beaux-Arts pedagogy – in the early 1900s, the curriculum followed the model of Paris’s École des Beaux-Arts, reflecting Argentina’s turn-of-the-century orientation toward Europe
en.wikipedia.org
. Over time, the school grew exponentially and became its own faculty (FADU) in 1947
en.wikipedia.org
. Today, FADU is one of the largest architecture/design faculties in the world, with around 25,000–26,000 students enrolled in architecture, graphic design, industrial design, urbanism, and related programs
en.wikipedia.org
. This makes it the third-largest faculty within UBA by enrollment
en.wikipedia.org
, and indeed a small city of future architects and designers. FADU’s prestige and impact in Latin America are hard to overstate. It has been a leader in architectural education for decades, known for rigorous training and for producing professionals who combine creative design skills with strong theoretical and technical foundations. Notable alumni include architects who have shaped Argentine architecture and beyond – for instance, Clorindo Testa, designer of the iconic Bank of London building in Buenos Aires, was a UBA alumnus. (Many other UBA graduates became influential in academia and practice, though the school perhaps prides itself more on the strength of its programs than celebrity alumni per se.) The faculty’s influence also comes through its sheer output: FADU graduates hundreds of architects each year, who then disseminate contemporary ideas across Latin America. FADU has long been a hub of intellectual ferment, often tied to social and political movements. During the 1960s, it endured turmoil like the “Night of the Long Batons” (1966), when a military intervention in universities led many professors to exile
en.wikipedia.org
. Despite such challenges, FADU remained a bastion of free thought and was at the forefront of introducing modern architectural currents to the region – from rationalist and Brutalist tendencies in the mid-20th century to more recent sustainability and computational design trends. The scale of FADU also means a vibrant, competitive environment: students often work through intense design studio nights, producing the famous “maquetas” (models) that litter the halls post-deadline (a scene any alum knows well). The faculty occupies a large modernist pavilion in UBA’s Ciudad Universitaria campus, where thousands of students stream in to attend studios and lectures. UBA FADU is tuition-free (as UBA is public and free), which underscores its role in social mobility and broad access – it draws students from all socioeconomic backgrounds, making it a melting pot of ideas and talent. The “prestige” of FADU comes not from elitist exclusivity, but from this meritocratic, massive training ground that has consistently ranked among Latin America’s top architecture schools. It also serves as a cultural institution – hosting exhibitions, lectures by famous architects, and maintaining an important architecture library and archive in Argentina. In Latin America, UBA FADU is often considered a reference point; its curricular approaches (like the vertical workshop system where each taller has its design philosophy) are emulated elsewhere. In summary, Juan Garassino’s alma mater FADU stands for academic excellence, scale, and Latin American leadership in architecture and design education. Its history (first in Argentina), size (tens of thousands of students), and influence (notable alumni and regional impact) make it central to understanding his foundational training

. Any graph of Juan’s knowledge network would surely link heavily to UBA FADU – symbolizing his roots in Buenos Aires’s strong design tradition and academic rigor.
École Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture de Paris-Malaquais (ENSAPM)
The École nationale supérieure d’architecture de Paris-Malaquais (ENSAPM) is one of France’s elite architecture schools, known for its historic location and progressive pedagogy. ENSAPM was established in its current form in 2001, but it inherits the legacy of the Paris Beaux-Arts tradition of architectural education
fr.wikipedia.org
fr.wikipedia.org
. In fact, ENSAPM is physically located within the historic compound of the École des Beaux-Arts in central Paris (on Rue Bonaparte, by the Seine)
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
. This site was the very cradle of French architectural education for over 200 years until 1968. The Mai 1968 student protests in Paris led to a reorganization of the old Beaux-Arts school into several independent “unités pédagogiques.” ENSAPM can be seen as a modern successor that upholds the artistic and intellectual lineage of the Beaux-Arts while updating it for the 21st century. It is now a component school of the University PSL (Paris Sciences & Lettres), reflecting an integration with a broader elite university network including other prestigious arts and science schools
fr.wikipedia.org
. Academically, ENSAPM is distinguished by its emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches and design experimentation. The school describes itself as “open and international…characterised by a diverse pedagogical program.”
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
 It notably offers a unique specialization in scenography (stage design), treating it as an architectural subject. Students can choose a Studio called “Architecture, Art, and Politics” (AAP) with a “Stage spaces” focus, where they work on theater stage design in collaboration with real theaters and technical teams
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
. This indicates ENSAPM’s orientation towards blending architecture with other arts and real-world programs – a nod to its Beaux-Arts heritage (where students historically designed opera sets, etc.) and a contemporary push towards new applications of architectural thinking. The curriculum spans bachelor and master cycles, culminating in the Diplôme d’architecte (equivalent to a Master’s)
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
. ENSAPM’s educational philosophy stresses strong design studios backed by theoretical courses, encouraging students to think critically about social issues, art, and technology in architecture
standout.naai-archi.com
quadriennaledeprague2019.fr
. Historically, ENSAPM was formed by reorganizing a previous school (Paris-La Défense, UP5) – in 2001, the faculty and resources of the old UP5 were split to create ENSAPM and Paris-Val de Seine, with ENSAPM moving into the Beaux-Arts central site
fr.wikipedia.org
. This gave ENSAPM a fresh start with venerable surroundings. Studying in the halls of the Beaux-Arts (with its classical courtyard, ateliers, and rich artistic atmosphere) undoubtedly provides inspiration and a sense of continuity. At the same time, ENSAPM has a modern, experimental reputation. It often collaborates with cultural institutions; for example, being in the heart of Paris’s art scene allows partnerships with museums, galleries, and the like. The school encourages international exchange (it hosts many foreign students and offers exchange programs – being in a prime location makes it attractive). With around 700 students in total (typical for a French ENSA), classes are selective; admission for French students is competitive, and international students might come through exchange or specialized masters. For Juan Garassino, ENSAPM would have provided a rich exposure to European architectural discourse and avant-garde design methods to complement his Argentine education. The academic orientation at ENSAPM – “centered on architectural design while covering necessary theory”
paris-malaquais.archi.fr
 and fostering ties to art and “poetics” of space – likely influenced his approach to merging AI and design. The school’s significance lies in its historical roots (Beaux-Arts site, founded to continue that legacy) and its contemporary specialties (scenography, art-politics studio), marking it as an institution bridging tradition and innovation in architecture. It also carries the prestige of being one of the 20 national architecture schools in France, often attracting top faculty and critics. ENSAPM’s position in central Paris and now within PSL means it’s at the heart of France’s design education network. Any knowledge graph node for ENSAPM would be connected to themes like Beaux-Arts, scenography, French architecture pedagogy, and Juan’s time in Paris – all relevant to understanding the global influences in his career.
